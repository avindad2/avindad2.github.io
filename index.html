  <h4 class="w3-center"><em>Analyzing the Weaknesses of Myself</em></h4>
  <p>One clear weakness that I see in myself is a lack of organization. I tend to find myself in situations where all my ideas are scattered all over the place. This disorganization makes it hard to retain some information in the long term since one concept has been jumbled around with a mix of ideas pertaining to the same overlying subject. However, this is a weakness that I have been overcoming for a quite a while. To combat this, I have tried to organize my ideas methodically and ahead of time in order to keep myself on track. Another weakness that I identify myself with is a slight lack of motivation. When it comes to creating ideas and figuring out ways to turn these ideas into tangible products, there are times where the steps needed to fruition my idea into life can become overwhelming. This sometimes signals me to work at a less efficient pace and thus lagging the entire process. I believe identifying these weaknesses is very important when it comes to striving for greatness in the future, since it allows me to see the flaws I must work on in order to succeed.</p>

      <h4 class="w3-center"><em>Analyzing the Strengths of Myself</em></h4>
      <p>When it comes to my beliefs regarding my own personal strengths, I believe that one certain strength I have is the ability to learn concepts/tasks quickly. Time and time again I find myself in situations where I have not been experienced or comfortable with the knowledge/assignment given at hand. For example, different technical internship experiences as well as personal AI projects had concepts I had never learned before. However, I had the ability to learn/master them (to a certain degree) within a couple of days. I believe that this ability has been very helpful for me in a technologically expanding business world. Another strength that goes hand in hand is being innovative by nature. This is a strength that has allowed me to spark interests in numerous subjects/topics that keep me interested/entertained (even during times like these) so I can learn new concepts that I can use to my advantage. </p>

    <p>From the feedback that I got from my friends and family, I learned that a majority of them agree that I have innovative abilities and leads them to the conclusion that I am also smart since I am able to come up with new ideas quickly. It is very interesting to see how many people also agree that one of my strengths is being innovative and it makes me proud that I am able to brand myself in a way to allows other people to see that trait in me. One strength that others believed I identified strongly with is being</p>

    <p>hard-working. Seventy-six percent of my surveyors believed that I was hard-working and I believe it is due to the fact that I tend to become interested in different tasks and work at it in order to produce a successful result. Another surprising result was the fact that only a low percentage of people agreed with me that a weakness of mine was being lazy/lack of motivation. I will discuss this more in section  "Congruence/Incongruence".</p>

  <div class="w3-row">
    <h3 class="w3-center"><em>Similarities</em></h3>
    <p>Some surprising similarities that I found between my internal and external self-analysis is that innovation is a prime strength of mine. In my survey, I also had smart as a characteristic that had a correlation with people who chose the attribute “innovative”. It proves that my perception of myself correlates with reality since other people also agree that I have the ability to create new ideas easily. </p>

    </div>
    <h3 class="w3-center"><em>Dissimilarities</em></h3>
    <p>The dissimilarities found in this self-analysis is an overwhelming number of people believed that hard-working was a strength of mine. I believe that my tendency to learn about a topic quickly and figuring out solutions translates to people perceiving me as someone who is hardworking. Although I am able to get an idea/concept correctly does not necessarily mean I am genuinely very hard-working. I think that my personal belief that I am a quick-learner is the reason for this confusion. Another dissimilarity I found during my self-analysis is that only a small number of people agreed that being lazy was a weakness of mine. I think the perception of both of the two strengths mentioned previously, (more info in section External Analysis) makes it seem that being lazy does not go hand in hand with these ideals. This dissimilarity is a great one to have and I must use this analysis and reasoning to make sure I stay motivated/hardworking.</p>
